## Description

I have built this Weather Dashboard application using a combination of JQuery, Bootstrap, moment.js and CSS. With this app, you are able to search for any location in the world to see the current weather and the forecasted weather for the next 5 days. All searched locations are saved under a search history so if you'd like to revisit a place you've already searched, you can just click on it to display the weather.

Start searching by typing in a location in the input box and either hit the 'enter' key or click on the 'Search' button. This will display the weather data and save your search in the search history. If you click on any of the locations saved in your search history, it will update and show the weather for the selected location. To clear your search history, simply click on the 'Clear Search' button:
